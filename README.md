This repo contains a shiny app called CDC explorer.

## CDC explorer

The app is available on
[shinyapps.io](https://hewag1975.shinyapps.io/cdcexplorer/)

The CDC explorer (CDC = Climate Data Center) is a shiny app the
visualizes climate data published by the national German wheather
service (DWD). All data are freely avaialable through the [DWD Open Data
Portal](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/). Kudos to
Berry Boessenkool for the [rdwd-package](https://github.com/brry/rdwd)
which simplifies access and data retrieval for R users a lot.
